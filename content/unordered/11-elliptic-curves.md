# regex

regex is so cool and im going to prove that with a couple of exercises.
first of all you should absolutely familiarize yourself with [regex101](https://regex101.com/).

?. i had this text i was writing:

> each node has a `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`.
> blablabla
> 
> to remove a column, blabla
> 
> to remove a row, blabla
> 
> ```python
> def remove_row ():
>     return 0 
> 
> def remove_col ():
>     return 0 
> ```

> to model a sudoku as an `exact cover problem` we need to decide on $S, X$ such that the computed $S^*$ actually means something to us. a solved sudoku is one where all cells satisfy with the constraints. <br>
> so we can decide on $X=\{a_{i,j}, b_{i,j}, c_{i,j}, | 0<=i,j<=8, a_{i,j}, b_{i,j}, c_{i,j} \in {0,1}\}$ <br>
> where $a_{i,j}$ is the binary variable that is $1$ if the cell at position $(i,j)$ satisfies rule no $1$,
>  $b_{i,j}, c_{i,j}$ are the same but for rules $2, 3$ respectively. 
> and $S$ being all possible
